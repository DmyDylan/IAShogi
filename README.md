# IAShogi
This is all the files of my 1st year group project on an AI able to play Shogi. Several methods have been tested.
The report summarizing all the work done is written in French.
3 AI were tested. AOJR is an AI based on the AlphaZero model by DeepMind but required a too high computational power to achieve satisfactory results. SNN (Simple Neural Network) is a simpler model using only neural networks. And finally, AB uses the alpha-beta algorithm.
